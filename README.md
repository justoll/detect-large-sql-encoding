# detect-large-sql-encoding
Detects or guesses the encoding of large given SQL-files (different SQL-formats).

The library is especially designed for (very) large SQL files. Many GB are not a problem and in many cases this also takes only a few (milli-)seconds. Nevertheless, for some encodings a statistical analysis is required, this causes a longer computation time in these cases for good results.

This Library is also resilient to isolated encoding errors or small areas of deviating encoding.

    ./configure
    make 
    make check
    make install

Then continue with the Readme.md-files in the subdirectories
You will need libDetectSQLEncoding as a basis for the standalone and Python version
